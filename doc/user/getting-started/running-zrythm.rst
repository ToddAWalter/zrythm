Running Zrythm
==============

Initial Configuration
---------------------

When you first run Zrythm, it will display a dialog
that lets you configure the basic settings that
Zrythm will use. These include the
:ref:`Zrythm user path <configuration/preferences:Zrythm User Path>` and the language of the
user interface.

Language
  Zrythm lets you choose the language of the
  interface. The interface is already translated in
  `multiple languages <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/zrythm/#languages>`_,
  so choose the language you are most comfortable in.

  .. note:: You must have a locale enabled for the
    language you want to use.
Path
  This is the :ref:`Zrythm user path <configuration/preferences:Zrythm User Path>`.

.. tip:: More settings are
   available in the :ref:`preferences`.

Plugin Scan
-----------
When the first run wizard is completed, Zrythm will
start
:doc:`scanning for plugins <../plugins-files/plugins/scanning>`.

Finally, Zrythm will ask you to
:doc:`load or create a project <../projects/saving-loading>`
and then the
:doc:`main interface <../zrythm-interface/overview>`
will show up.
