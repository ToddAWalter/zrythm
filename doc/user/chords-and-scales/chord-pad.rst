Chord Pad
=========

Overview
--------

The chord pad contains 12 pads (1 for each key on a
piano keyboard) that can be used to trigger chords.
The chord pad can be found in the bottom panel.

These 12 chords are linked to the chords in the
:ref:`Chord Editor <editing/chord-editor:Chord Editor>`.

Presets
-------

Zrythm comes with pre-installed chord presets, and
it also allows you to generate chord presets from
scales, or even save your own.

Preset Packs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of preset packs and presets is found in the
:ref:`Right Panel <zrythm-interface/right-panel:Right Panel>`
under :guilabel:`Chord Preset Browser`.

You can audition chord presets by selecting an
instrument plugin from the list and using the available
playback controls. This works similarly to

Zrythm comes with some standard packs that cannot be
renamed or deleted.

Custom Packs

Chord Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking on the chord button will bring up the
chord selector window that allows you to change
the current chord.

   Chord selector

At the moment, only the :guilabel:`Chord Creator` tab
is functional. A chord can be created by selecting
its root note, its type, its accent and its bass note.

Selecting :guilabel:`In scale` under
:guilabel:`Visibility`
will only show options that correspond to chords
inside the currently active scale.
This makes it easy to create chords that
stay in the current scale.

Inversions
~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking on the left or right arrows will allow you
to invert the chord. Each inversion towards the right
moves the lowest note in the chord one octave higher,
and each inversion towards the left moves the highest
note in the chord one octave below.

Piano Roll Integration
----------------------

Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use highlighting inside the piano roll
to highlight the notes corresponding to the scale,
chord, or both at the position of the playhead.
See :ref:`editing/editor-toolbars:Chord/Scale Highlighting` for more information.
