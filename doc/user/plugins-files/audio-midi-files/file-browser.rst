File Browser
============

The File Browser makes it easy to navigate
through files on your computer or through
your custom collections.

Bookmarks
---------
The Bookmarks section contains a list of bookmarked
directories. Double-clicking on a directory will
show its contents in the file list below.

Standard Bookmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Zrythm provides standard bookmarks for
:file:`Home` and :file:`Desktop`, which correspond
to the home and desktop directories of the current
user.

Custom Bookmarks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Custom bookmarks can be added by right-clicking on
a directory in the file list and selecting
:guilabel:`Add Bookmark`.

Similarly, custom bookmarks can be removed by
right-clicking on the bookmark and selecting
:guilabel:`Delete`.

Filter Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Similarly to the
:doc:`plugin browser <../plugins/plugin-browser>`,
files can be filtered based on their type.

the file list. To also show unsupported files,
enable :guilabel:`Show unsupported files` in the
:ref:`file browser preferences <plugins-files/audio-midi-files/file-browser:Preferences>`.

Showing Hidden Files

shown in the file list. To also show hidden files,

:ref:`file browser preferences <plugins-files/audio-midi-files/file-browser:Preferences>`.

Auditioning

Audio and MIDI files can be auditioned by making
use of the auditioning controls at the bottom of the
