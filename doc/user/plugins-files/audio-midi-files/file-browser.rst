Importing Files
---------------

There are various ways to import MIDI and audio files into a project.

Drag and Drop From a File Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can drag one or more files from your system's file browser or from the
built-in file browser into a track (if applicable), into empty space in the timeline or
into empty space in the tracklist or mixer.

Droping onto an existing track will
import the file on that track (if possible), and dropping onto empty space
will create one or more new tracks (depending on the number of dropped files, or number of tracks contained in Type 1 MIDI files).

.. hint:: You can adjust the location where the dropped file will
   be inserted in the project by dropping at an appropriate spot

Activating a File From the Built-in File Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A file (row) can be activated by selecting a row and pressing the return key
or double-clicking it.

Tracklist/Mixer Context Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files can also be imported by right-clicking in empty space in the tracklist
or mixer and selecting :guilabel:`Import File...`
