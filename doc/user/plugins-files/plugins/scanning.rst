Scanning for Plugins
====================

Zrythm will scan for plugins on startup and will remember those plugins until
it is closed. Zrythm supports `CLAP`_, :term:`LV2`, :term:`VST2`,
:term:`VST3`, :term:`LADSPA`, :term:`DSSI` and :term:`AU` plugins.

:term:`SFZ` and :term:`SF2` instruments are also supported, and they are
treated as instrument plugins.

.. tip:: Plugin scanning can be disabled by setting the
   :envvar:`ZRYTHM_SKIP_PLUGIN_SCAN` environment variable.

Scan Paths
----------

Zrythm will scan for plugins in the plugin search paths specified in the
:ref:`preferences <configuration/preferences:Preferences>`.
If the search path is left empty, Zrythm will scan for plugins in the
standard paths according to the specifications of each plugin format (if any).

.. hint:: You can use environment variables (e.g., ``LV2_PATH``) when
   specifying search paths in the preferences. The allowed syntax is
   ``${ENV_VAR_NAME}`` where ``ENV_VAR_NAME`` is the name of the environment
   variable.

Plugin Cache
------------

Zrythm will remember scanned plugins and save this information in :ref:`the cached plugin descriptors file <appendix/files-and-directories:Cached Plugin Descriptors>`.

New plugins will be scanned on each start-up, and you can delete or edit this
file to force a re-scan of previously scanned plugins.

AU Scan
-------
On MacOS, :term:`AU` plugins will be scanned at their standard locations at
:file:`/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components` for system plugins and
:file:`~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components` for user plugins.

SFZ/SF2 Scan
------------
:term:`SFZ` and :term:`SF2` instruments will be scanned in all directories
and subdirectories specified in the
:ref:`preferences <configuration/preferences:Preferences>`.

About Flatpak
-------------

When using Zrythm as a Flatpak, only Flatpak plugins should be used (i.e.,
plugins using the `Linux Audio base extension`_).

.. warning:: While Zrythm allows the user to use plugins not
   packaged as Flatpaks,
   this is not recommended and we do not offer support if it
   causes issues.

.. note:: Flatpak builds have no access to :file:`/usr`
   so it is not possible to use system plugins, even when
   using the environment variables above.
