Plugin Window
=============

Custom UIs
----------
When Plugin UIs are opened, a window such as the following
will be displayed, if the plugin ships with its own UI. This
window may contain additions by Zrythm (such as
`File` and `Presets` menus).

Generic UIs
-----------
If the plugin does not ship with its own UI, the following
generic UI will be generated for it.

Bridging
--------
Most plugins are instantiated in the same process as Zrythm.
This has the advantage that :term:`DSP` is very fast, however,
some plugin UIs are not compatible with Zrythm and need to be
bridged (ie, run as separate processes).

.. note:: When it is possible to bridge only the UI,
  Zrythm will do so, and this will not have any
  performance implications on DSP. If bridging the whole
  plugin is required, this will have some performance
  implications, since it is required to communicate
  with the plugin in another process.

This process is transparent to the user and only
mentioned for reference.

Opening Plugins in Bridged Mode
-------------------------------
Sometimes, you may need to manually tell Zrythm
to open plugins in a specific way. You can find the
options available for each plugin by right clicking
on the plugin in the :ref:`plugin-browser`.

   Opening ZynAddSubFX in bridged mode

Zrythm will remember the last setting used for each
plugin and automatically apply it when you choose to
instantiate that plugin from the plugin browser.
