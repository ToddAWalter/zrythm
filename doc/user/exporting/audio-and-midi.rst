Artist and Genre

These will be included as metadata to the exported
file if the format supports it. The title used will
be the project title.

Format
~~~~~~
The format to export to. The formats mentioned in
:ref:`Supported Formats <plugins-files/audio-midi-files/overview:Supported Formats>`
are available, with the exception of MP3.

Dither

Apply low-level noise to the audio to remove quantization distortion that occurs when reducing the bit depth.

.. tip:: Dithering is typically applied as the final step of mastering.

Bit Depth
~~~~~~~~~
This is the bit depth that will be used when
exporting audio. The higher the bit depth the
larger the file will be, but it will have better
quality.

Time Range
~~~~~~~~~~
The time range to export. You can choose to export
the whole song (defined by the start/end markers),
the current loop range or a custom time range.

Filename Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The pattern to use as the name of the file.

Mixdown
-------
When exporting the mixdown, sound from all selected

Stems
-----
Exporting stems means that each selected track
will be exported in its own file. This is useful
when you want to share the components of your song
separately. For example, you can
:term:`bounce <Bounce>` the drums and the bass
as separate audio files.
