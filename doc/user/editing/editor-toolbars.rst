Snapping and Grid Options
-------------------------

This menu button allows adjusting snapping and grid display options.

.. figure:: /_static/img/snap-grid-options.png
   :align: center

   Snap/Grid options

Each option is explained below.

Position Snap
  Turn snapping on or off.
Adaptive Snap
  Automatically adjust snapping behavior to the current zoom level, based on the selected note type.
Snap to
  Note size/length to snap to. This is only visible if :guilabel:`Adaptive Snap` is turned off.
Note Type
  Normal
    Snap to the selected (or automatically determined) note length.
  Triplet
    Snap to 2/3rds of the selected note length.
  Dotted
    Snap to 3/2nds (1.5 times) the selected note length.
Keep Offset
  When snapping, keep the offset of objects from the nearest snap point on their left.
Default Object Length
  The length to use when creating new objects. The following options are available.

  Link to Snap
    Use the same note length as the snap length above.
  Last Object
    Use the length of the last created object.
  Custom
    Specify a custom length.

Quantization
------------

Objects can be quantized to specified positions by using
the Quantize and Quick-Quantize actions.

.. image:: /_static/img/quantize-buttons.png
   :align: center

Quantize
~~~~~~~~
Clicking the Quantize button will open up a popup that
will let you specify the settings to quantize the current
selection with.

.. image:: /_static/img/quantize-options.png
   :align: center

Quantize to
  Select the note length and type to quantize to.
Adjust
  Select if you want to quantize the start positions, the
  end positions (on objects that have length), or both.
Amount
  Select the amount to quantize by. 100% will quantize to
  the given options fully, while 0% will perform no
  quantization.
Swing
  Select a swing amount.
Randomization
  This will randomize the resulting positions by the given
  amount of ticks, and is useful for adding a "human feel"
  to quantized events.

Clicking Quantize will perform the quantization and save
the settings for quick quantization with Quick-Quantize.

Quick-Quantize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will perform quantization based on the last known
settings.

Playhead Tracking
-----------------

Zrythm includes functionality for forcing the
playhead to remain inside the visibile area during
playback.

.. figure:: /_static/img/playhead-tracking.png
   :align: center

   Playhead tracking controls

Scroll when Playhead Reaches Edge
  Automatically  scroll the visible area when the
  playhead moves outside it
Follow Playhead
  Keep the visible area centered at the position
  of the playhead

Zooming
-------
The timeline and each editor
include horizontal (and sometimes vertical) zooming functionality.

.. figure:: /_static/img/zoom-buttons.png
   :align: center

   Zoom buttons

Zoom In
  Zoom in at the location of the playhead
Zoom Out
  Zoom out
Original Size
  Zoom back to the default zoom level
Best Fit
  Zoom in or out as much as required to show all of
  the events in the arranger

Event Viewers
-------------

Clicking the :guilabel:`Toggle Event Viewer` button will display an
event viewer (or `list editor`) that shows all events in the corresponding editor as a list.

.. figure:: /_static/img/timeline-event-viewer.png
   :align: center

   Timeline event viewer

Sorting
~~~~~~~

Columns in the header row can be clicked to sort
the events in ascending or descending order.

Editing
~~~~~~~

Some values can be changed by clicking in the
corresponding field to enter edit mode, then
pressing :kbd:`Enter` when done.

.. figure:: /_static/img/event-viewer-edit-mode.png
   :align: center

   Edit mode

Object Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The object selection in the event viewer is linked
to the arranger. This means that selecting objects
inside the event viewer will also select them inside
the arranger and vice-versa.

Timeline Controls
-----------------

The following controls are only available in the timeline toolbar.

Range Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Range actions are performed on the selected :term:`range <Range>`.

Insert Silence
  Insert empty space at the selected range and push all events in the range forward.
Remove Range
  Remove all objects inside the selected range and move events after the range backwards.

Object Merging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking this button will merge the selected regions. This button is deactivated when merging the currently selected regions is not possible.

The shortcut for object merging is :kbd:`Control-j`.

Piano Roll Controls
-------------------

The following controls are only available in the piano roll (MIDI editor).

.. figure:: /_static/img/piano-roll-toolbar.png
   :align: center

   Piano roll toolbar

Chord/Scale Highlighting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The highlighting option can be used to highlight notes corresponding to
the scale, chord, or both at ther start position.

The position of the playhead will determine highlighting of the piano roll keys on the left side of the piano roll.

.. figure:: /_static/img/scale-and-chord-highlighting.png
   :figwidth: image
   :align: center

   Scale and chord highlighting

Separate colors are used, in order of priority based on the following:

* The note is the current chord's (if any) bass note
* The note is both inside the current chord (if any) and the current scale (if any)
* The note is inside the current chord (if any)
* The note is inside the current scale (if any)
* The note is neither in the current chord or scale, or there is no current chord or scale

.. seealso:: See the :ref:`Chord Track <tracks/track-types:Chord Track>`, :ref:`Chord Editor <editing/chord-editor:Chord Editor>` and :ref:`Chord Pad <chords-and-scales/chord-pad:Chord Pad>` for details.

MIDI Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MIDI functions are logic that can be applied to transform the selected MIDI notes. The following functions are available.

Crescendo
  Gradually increase the velocities of the selected
  notes from low to high. Used to create a climax.
Flam
  Create additional MIDI notes right after the start
  position of each selected note. This is usually
  used on snares.
Flip
  Reverse/flip the selected notes horizontally or
  vertically.
Legato
  Connect all selected notes so that they play
  smoothly.
Portato
  Similar to legato, but leaves some space between
  the notes.
Staccato
  Make the selected notes short and punctuated.
Strum Up/Down
  Shift the position and velocity of notes that
  start at the same position (chords) to simulate
  strumming, like when playing guitar.

.. todo:: Add illustrations.

In the future, it will be possible to implement
custom functions using user scripts.

Ghost Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Zrythm will only display MIDI notes in the selected region. Clicking the mask buton will *ghost* (display with less opacity) MIDI notes
from other regions in the same track.

.. figure:: /_static/img/ghosted-notes.png
   :align: center

   Ghosted notes on the right

Clicking on a ghosted note will automatically switch the active/selected region to the
clicked MIDI note's parent region.

Automation Editor Controls
--------------------------

Automation Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automation functions are logic that can be applied
to transform the selected automation points/curves.
The following functions are available.

Flip
  Reverse/flip the selected automation horizontally
  or vertically.

Audio Editor Controls
---------------------

Audio Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Audio functions are logic that can be applied
to transform the selected audio part.
The following functions are available.

Invert
  Invert the polarity of the audio.
Normalize Peak
  Normalize the audio so that its peak is 0dB.
Linear Fade In
  Fade the audio from silence to full amplitude.
Linear Fade Out
  Fade the audio from full amplitude to silence.
Nudge
  Shift the audio by 1 sample backward or forward.
Reverse
  Reverse the audio (play back backwards).
External Program
  Run an external program (such as
  `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/>`_)
  to edit the audio.

  .. figure:: /_static/img/edit-audio-external-app.png
     :align: center

     Edit the selected audio in an external app

  The selected program will be run with the path to
  a temporary file as an argument. Normally, the
  application will open that file, otherwise you will
  have to open it manually.

  .. hint:: You can select and copy the path in the
     dialog.

  Once you've made your changes to the file, close
  the external app and press OK. Zrythm will then
  apply your changes to the selected audio part.

  .. important:: The length of the audio must stay
     exactly the same, otherwise this operation will
     fail.
