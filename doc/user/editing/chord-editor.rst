   Chord editor

The chord editor has a list of chords on the left
side that can be changed, and an arranger on the
right side for creating chord progressions from chord objects.
Chord objects signify the start of a chord (they do not have length).

Chords
------
A chord in the context of the chord editor refers
to a chord on the left side of the editor.

   Chords inside the chord editor

These chords correspond to each chord in the
:ref:`Chord pad <chords-and-scales/chord-pad:Chord Pad>`.

The controls available are similar to those in
the chord pad.
