The ruler will display more or less information
depending on the current zoom level. It will also
display the following markers/indicators discussed in
:ref:`loop-points-and-markers`.

Cue point
  Displayed as a blue, right-pointing arrow.
Playhead position
  Shown as a grey, down-facing arrow.
Loop points
  Shown as 2 green arrows, and the area between them is shown in bright green
  if loop is enabled, or grey if disabled. Can be dragged to reposition.

  .. tip:: Looping can be enabled/disabled using the loop button in the :ref:`transport controls <playback-and-recording/transport-controls:Controls>`.

Clicking and dragging on empty space in the
bottom half of the ruler will allow
you to reposition the playhead.
