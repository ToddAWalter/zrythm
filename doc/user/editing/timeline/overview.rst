Overview
========
Editing in the timeline is the most common workflow
inside Zrythm. The timeline section consists of the
:ref:`tracklist <tracks/tracklist:Tracklist>` on the left and the ruler/arranger on the
right, along with a timeline-specific toolbar at the
top.

Minimap
-------
The timeline minimap is a little box that represents the
current visible area of the timeline. It can be moved around
and resized to change the visible area.

The rest of the timeline elements are explained in the
following sections.
