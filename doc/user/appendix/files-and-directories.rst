user data. See :ref:`Zrythm user path <configuration/preferences:Zrythm User Path>` for details.

Installed Files
---------------
When Zrythm is installed, it installs the following
files by default.

Desktop Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `freedesktop-compliant configuration file <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html>`_
that describes how a particular program should be
launched, how it appears in menus, etc. This is
normally installed at
:file:`/usr/share/applications/zrythm.desktop`.

GLib Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains the schema for user
configurations. It is normally installed at
:file:`/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.zrythm.Zrythm.gschema.xml`.

This is used by the desktop environment. Normally
installed at
:file:`/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/zrythm.svg`.

Localization Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Localization files are installed under
:file:`/usr/share/locale`. For example,
:file:`/usr/share/locale/ko/LC_MESSAGES/zrythm.mo`
for Korean.

Samples
~~~~~~~
Default audio samples used by Zrythm (such as the
metronome). Normally installed under

normally be installed under
:file:`/usr/share/zrythm/themes`.

.. hint:: Zrythm provides ways to override some of
   these files with user-specified files in the
   :ref:`Zrythm user path <configuration/preferences:Zrythm User Path>`. See
   :ref:`theming/intro:Theming` for details.

User Files

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains your plugin collections.
It is found at
:file:`plugin_collections.yaml` under the

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Located at :file:`plugin-settings.yaml` under the
:ref:`Zrythm user path <configuration/preferences:Zrythm User Path>`, this is a collection of
per-plugin settings, such as whether to open the
plugin with :term:`Carla`, the
:ref:`bridge mode <plugins-files/plugins/plugin-window:Opening Plugins in Bridged Mode>`
to use and whether to use a
:ref:`generic UI <plugins-files/plugins/plugin-window:Generic UIs>`.

Log File
--------
Zrythm will write to a log file on each run inside
the :file:`log` subdirectory under the
:ref:`Zrythm user path <configuration/preferences:Zrythm User Path>`. The filename will contain
the current date and time, for example
:file:`log_2020-06-26_15-34-19.log`.

This log file is useful for debugging crashes and
other problems.
