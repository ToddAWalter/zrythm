Track Operations
================

.. tip:: All Track operations are undoable.

Track Selection
---------------

Tracks are selected by clicking on them, either in the tracklist or in the mixer.
There is also an option to auto-select tracks when a track object is selected in the timeline.

.. todo:: Explain this option.

Multiple tracks can be selected by pressing and holding :kbd:`Control` while clicking them.

Moving/Copying Tracks
---------------------
Tracks can be moved by clicking on one of the selected tracks and dragging and dropping them to another location.
The drop locations will be highlighted as you move the Track.

Holding down :kbd:`Control` while dropping will cause the tracks to be
cloned (copied) instead of moved.

~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~

The track name can be changed by double-clicking on it in the track view, in the track inspector, or in the channel.

Show/Hide Plugin UI
-------------------

.. Lock
    Prevent any edits on the track while locked.

  Freeze
    Bounce the track to an audio file internally and
