GTK Tips

# dispose() vs finalize() vs destroy()

According to ebassi from GTK:
Rule of thumb: use dispose()
for releasing references to objects you acquired
from the outside, and finalize() to release
memory/references you allocated internally.

There's basically no reason to
override `destroy()`; always use `dispose`/`finalize`.
The "destroy" signal is for
other code, using your widget, to release
references they might have.

# map() vs realize()

Alexander Mikhaylenko:
```
map - if you put it into a stack and switch pages,
it will map/unmap every time, but will still be
realized the whole time
realized == when it's in a realized window iirc
but basically you can access the window and you have access to rendering stuff
mapped == when it's actually gonna be drawn, yes
```

# Popovers
Thanks to ebassi from GTK:
always make sure that the popover opens inside
the window; make the window request a minimum
size that allows the popover to be fully
contained; or make the contents of the popover
be small enough to fit into a small top level
parent window

# Specify menu for GtkMenuButton in XML

Specify the id of the menu, like:

```xml
<property name="menu">my_menu_id</property>
```

# Set max height on GtkScrolledWindow

Set `propagate-natural-height` to true and set
max height with `max-content-height`.

# GDK key defines and accel strings

- `include/gtk-3.0/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h`
- `gdk_keyval_name()`
- `gdk_keyval_from_name()`

# Showing popups on startup

First need to set style provider in
`zrythm_app_startup()` otherwise we get segfaults.

# Custom widget text node styling

mclasen:
```
if you call append_layout, you provide the pango layout that specifies what fonts to use
if it is a pango layout created with gtk_widget_create_pango_layout then yes, css may influence what font is used
```

# `focus_on_click` in custom widgets

```
Sergey Bugaev
Focus on click doesn't work automatically, it has to be implemented in a particular widget (by connecting to GestureClick::pressed or something like that and calling grab_focus ())
And you can set focus-on-click to false to disable that (and that's again something that the particular widget has to check for, and not call grab_focus ()) in that case
```

# Storing Objects in GListStore

When storing objects (such as newly-created WrappedObjectWithChangeSignal) in a `GListStore` using `g_list_store_append()`, the list store takes a reference to the object. However, `g_object_new()` returns an owned reference, so it needs to be dropped after appending to avoid leaking the instance.

To do this, either:

1. Unref the object after appending:
   ```c
   gpointer obj = g_object_new (type, NULL);
   g_list_store_append (store, obj);
   g_object_unref (obj);
   ```

2. Use `g_autoptr` to automatically unref the object when it goes out of scope:
   ```c
   {
     g_autoptr (GObject) obj = g_object_new (type, NULL);
     g_list_store_append (store, obj);
   }
   ```

If creating initially floating objects, inherit from `GInitiallyUnowned`, sink the floating reference using `g_object_ref_sink()`, append to the list store, and then unref:

```c
gpointer obj = g_object_ref_sink (g_object_new (type, NULL));
g_list_store_append (store, obj);
g_object_unref (obj);
```

In general, avoid floating references whenever possible.
