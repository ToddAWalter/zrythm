# Zrythm Undo/Redo Architecture

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Model layer: pure data & properties, no undo awareness.
  - Commands: immutable, reversible single-concern mutations.
  - Undo-Stack: owns commands, persistence, global hooks.
  - Actions (Operators): thin, stateless façade that only produces commands.
  - UI (QML): declarative views that use operators to edit values, zero direct model mutation.
  - Factories: handle creation and initialization of model objects.

- **No global state**: one undo-stack per project, exposed via standard QML type registration.

- **Tooling-friendly**: no root-context properties, no singletons.

| Module        | Responsibility                                | Public API Examples |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `zrythm::dsp`    | Low-level DSP types & processor graphs        | `ProcessorParameter` |
| `zrythm::model`  | Data objects (`Track`, `Clip`, `Plugin`)      | `Track::setName()`  |
| `zrythm::model::Factories` | Object creation & initialization        | `TrackFactory::create()` |
| `zrythm::commands` | Concrete `QUndoCommand` subclasses          | `RenameTrackCmd`, `AddTrackCmd` |
| `zrythm::undo`   | Undo-stack container, save/load, hooks        | `UndoStack` QML type|
| `zrythm::actions` | Controllers that expose semantic actions   | `TrackOperator::rename()`, `ProjectActions.addMidiTrack()` |
| `zrythm::gui`    | Qt-Quick UI, makes changes via operators      | `TrackView.qml`     |

## 3. Architecture Overview

The architecture supports two primary operations:
1. **Editing existing objects** via Operator classes (stateful, per-object)
2. **Adding new objects** via Action functions (stateless, global)

### Object Editing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Q as QML UI
    participant O as Operator
    participant S as UndoStack
    participant C as Command
    participant M as Model

    Q->>O: rename("Intro")
    O->>C: new RenameTrackCmd(...)
    O->>S: push(C)
    S->>C: redo()
    C->>M: setName("Intro")
    M-->>Q: nameChanged()
```

### Object Creation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Q as QML UI
    participant A as ProjectActions
    participant F as Factory
    participant S as UndoStack
    participant C as Command
    participant M as Model
    participant R as Registry

    Q->>A: addMidiTrack()
    A->>F: create(registry)
    F->>R: createObject()
    R-->>F: newObjectId
    F-->>A: newObjectId
    A->>C: new AddTrackCmd(project, newObjectId)
    A->>S: push(C)
    S->>C: redo()
    C->>M: tracks.add(newObjectId)
    M-->>Q: tracksChanged()
```

## 4. Component Responsibilities

### Models (`zrythm::model`)
- Represent the persistent state of the application
- Contain business logic and data (Track, Clip, Project, etc.)
- All instances owned by a central Registry with unique, reference-counted IDs
- No knowledge of undo/redo systems or UI

### Factories (`zrythm::model`)
- Handle creation and initial configuration of model objects
- Reside alongside the model classes they create
- Assign unique IDs from the Registry
- Set up default state and internal connections

### Commands (`zrythm::commands`)
- Perform single, reversible operations on models
- Derive from `QUndoCommand`
- Implement `redo()` (apply change) and `undo()` (revert change)
- Dumb and focused - know how to apply/revert changes but not why

### Actions (`zrythm::actions`)
Two types of actions:
1. **Operators**: Stateful, per-object actions for editing (e.g., `TrackOperator`)
2. **Global Actions**: Stateless functions for object creation (e.g., `ProjectActions.addMidiTrack()`)

Responsibilities:
- Provide high-level, QML-friendly API
- Orchestrate complex operations (potentially multiple commands)
- Use Factories to create new objects
- Create Commands and push to UndoStack

### Undo Stack (`zrythm::undo`)
- Owns and manages command lifecycle
- Handles persistence and serialization
- Provides global hooks for undo/redo events
- Exposed as QML type for UI integration

## 5. QML Integration Patterns

### Editing Existing Objects
```qml
// TrackView.qml
import Zrythm 1.0

required property UndoStack projectUndo
required property Track currentTrack

TrackOperator {
    id: trackOp
    track: currentTrack
    undoStack: projectUndo
}

TextField {
    text: trackOp.track.name
    onEditingFinished: trackOp.rename(text)
}
```

### Adding New Objects
```qml
// ProjectToolbar.qml
import Zrythm 1.0

required property UndoStack projectUndo

Button {
    text: "Add MIDI Track"
    onClicked: ProjectActions.addMidiTrack(projectUndo)
}
```

---

## 6. Checklist for New Undoable Action

### For Editing Existing Objects:
1. Add model setter (if not present)
2. Add command class in `zrythm::commands`
3. Implement operator method in `zrythm::actions`
4. Register command for (de)serialization
5. Add unit tests for command + operator
6. Expose operator to QML if UI needs it

### For Adding New Objects:
1. Add factory class in `zrythm::model::Factories`
2. Add command class in `zrythm::commands`
3. Implement action function in `zrythm::actions`
4. Register command for (de)serialization
5. Add unit tests for factory, command and action
6. Expose action to QML

---

## 7. Non-Undoable State
- View-only flags (visibility, window geometry) bypass operators; mutate model or view-model directly.

---

## 8. Key Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, distinct purpose
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic for creation, policy, and mechanism is isolated
3. **Testability**:
   - Commands can be tested with mock objects
   - Actions can be tested by checking which commands they push
   - Factories can be tested for proper object initialization
4. **Lifetime Management**: Registry and reference-counted IDs ensure object safety
5. **UI Agnosticism**: Core Model and Command logic is independent of QML/Qt Widgets

This architecture ensures that Zrythm's codebase remains robust, flexible, and maintainable as it grows in complexity.
