# Playback Cache Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture for caching track events for real-time playback. The system provides thread-safe caching of MIDI, audio, and automation events to prevent threading issues between UI operations and real-time audio processing.

## Problem Statement

The architecture solves the problem described in [GitLab issue #5140](https://gitlab.zrythm.org/zrythm/zrythm/-/work_items/5140) where reading live data from the UI while audio threads are processing causes threading conflicts. Previously, the engine had to be stopped on each edit, causing poor user experience.

## Architectural Goals

- **Thread Safety**: Allow UI modifications while audio processing continues uninterrupted
- **Performance**: Minimize overhead for real-time audio processing
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple event types (MIDI, audio, automation)
- **Efficiency**: Only update changed portions of the timeline
- **Debouncing**: Avoid excessive cache regeneration during rapid UI changes

## Key Components

### 1. PlaybackCacheScheduler

Located in [`src/utils/playback_cache_scheduler.h`](src/utils/playback_cache_scheduler.h)

**Purpose**: Collects and debounces cache requests, then triggers cache generation.

**Key Features:**
- Debounces multiple rapid requests into single operations
- Expands affected ranges to ensure complete coverage
- Configurable delay for optimal performance

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PlaybackCacheScheduler {
        +queueCacheRequestForRange(start, end)
        +queueFullCacheRequest()
        +queueCacheRequest(range)
        +setDelay(ms)
        #cacheRequested(range) signal
        -QTimer timer
        -std::chrono::milliseconds delay
        -bool pending_call
        -std::optional~ExpandableTickRange~ affected_range
    }
```

### 2. ExpandableTickRange

Located in [`src/utils/expandable_tick_range.h`](src/utils/expandable_tick_range.h)

**Purpose**: Represents a range of ticks that can be expanded to include additional ranges.

**Key Features:**
- Can represent full content or specific ranges
- Supports range expansion operations
- Handles conversion between ticks and samples

### 3. MidiPlaybackCache

Located in [`src/dsp/midi_playback_cache.h`](src/dsp/midi_playback_cache.h)

**Purpose**: Stateful cache holder that manages MIDI event sequences for playback.

**Key Features:**
- Stores sequences by interval for efficient updates
- Validates event boundaries and ensures note completeness
- Merges sequences for final playback

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MidiPlaybackCache {
        +clear()
        +remove_sequences_matching_interval(interval)
        +add_sequence(interval, sequence)
        +finalize_changes()
        +cached_events() const
        -std::map~IntervalType, juce::MidiMessageSequence~ event_sequences_
        -juce::MidiMessageSequence merged_events_
    }
```

### 4. TimelineMidiEventProvider

Located in [`src/structure/tracks/timeline_midi_event_provider.h`](src/structure/tracks/timeline_midi_event_provider.h)

**Purpose**: Bridge between the playback cache system and track processors, providing MIDI events for real-time playback.

**Key Features:**
- Generates MIDI event sequences from timeline regions
- Manages thread-safe access to cached events using `farbot::RealtimeObject`
- Processes events for specific time ranges during audio processing
- Handles range-based cache updates for efficiency

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class TimelineMidiEventProvider {
        +generate_events(tempo_map, midi_regions, affected_range)
        +process_events(time_info, output_buffer)
        -set_midi_events(events)
        -farbot::RealtimeObject active_midi_playback_sequence_
        -MidiPlaybackCache midi_playback_cache_
    }
```

### 5. Track and TrackProcessor Integration

**Track** ([`src/structure/tracks/track.h`](src/structure/tracks/track.h)):
- Owns the `MidiPlaybackCache` instance
- Contains `PlaybackCacheScheduler` for managing requests
- Connects to arrangement object changes

**TrackProcessor** ([`src/structure/tracks/track_processor.h`](src/structure/tracks/track_processor.h)):
- Uses `TimelineMidiEventProvider` for MIDI event access
- Implements the playback interface using cached events
- Integrates with the track's event provider system

## Signal Flow

The caching process follows this sequence:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as UI/Arranger Object
    participant AOLM as ArrangerObjectListModel
    participant Scheduler as PlaybackCacheScheduler
    participant Track as Track
    participant Provider as TimelineMidiEventProvider
    participant Cache as MidiPlaybackCache
    participant Processor as TrackProcessor

    UI->>AOLM: Object changed (position, content, etc.)
    AOLM->>Scheduler: contentChanged(affectedRange)
    Scheduler->>Scheduler: Debounce and expand range
    Scheduler->>Track: cacheRequested(finalRange)
    Track->>Provider: generate_events(tempo_map, regions, range)
    Provider->>Cache: remove_sequences_matching_interval(range)
    Provider->>Provider: Process regions in range
    Provider->>Cache: add_sequence(interval, sequence)
    Provider->>Cache: finalize_changes()
    Provider->>Provider: set_midi_events(cached_events())
    Provider->>Provider: Swap realtime cache (thread-safe)
    Processor->>Provider: process_events(time_info, output_buffer)
    Provider->>Processor: Return events for playback
```

## Real-time Safety

The architecture ensures real-time safety through:

1. **RealtimeObject**: Uses `farbot::RealtimeObject` for atomic cache swapping in `TimelineMidiEventProvider`
2. **Debouncing**: Prevents cache thrashing during rapid UI changes
3. **Range-based Updates**: Only processes affected portions of the timeline
4. **Separation of Concerns**: UI thread manages cache generation, audio thread uses cached data
5. **Event Provider Pattern**: `TimelineMidiEventProvider` abstracts the cache access pattern

## Event Types Support

### Currently Implemented
- **MIDI Events**: Fully implemented with region-based caching via `TimelineMidiEventProvider`
- **Audio Events**: Planned similar to MIDI implementation
- **Automation Events**: Will be handled in AutomationTracks

### Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to support additional event types:
- Template-based cache system for different event types
- Unified interface for all playback event caches
- Configurable caching strategies per event type
- Event provider pattern for different event types

## Performance Considerations

- **Debounce Timing**: 100ms default delay balances responsiveness and performance
- **Range Optimization**: Only processes changed regions, not entire timeline
- **Memory Efficiency**: Caches are stored in optimal formats for playback
- **CPU Usage**: Cache generation happens off the real-time thread
- **Event Provider Efficiency**: `TimelineMidiEventProvider` optimizes event access patterns

## Error Handling

- **Validation**: Events are validated to ensure they fit within specified intervals
- **Note Completeness**: Ensures all note-on events have corresponding note-offs
- **Tempo Awareness**: Properly handles tempo changes through tempo map integration
- **Provider Safety**: `TimelineMidiEventProvider` handles edge cases in event processing

## Usage Examples

### MIDI Cache Generation
```cpp
// In Track::regeneratePlaybackCaches
timeline_midi_event_provider_->generate_events(
    base_dependencies_.tempo_map_,
    lanes_view(),
    affectedRange
);
```

### Real-time Cache Access
```cpp
// In TrackProcessor::fill_midi_events
timeline_midi_event_provider_->process_events(
    time_info,
    output_buffer
);
```

## Related Components

- **ArrangerObjectListModel**: Propagates change notifications
- **TrackLaneList**: Contains MIDI regions and triggers cache updates
- **MidiRegionSerializer**: Converts MIDI regions to message sequences
- **TempoMap**: Provides timing conversion between ticks and samples
- **TimelineMidiEventProvider**: Bridge between cache system and track processors

## Conclusion

This caching architecture provides a robust solution for thread-safe playback. The addition of `TimelineMidiEventProvider` creates a clean separation between cache management and real-time event processing, improving maintainability and extensibility. The system balances performance, flexibility, and real-time safety while providing a foundation for future expansion to support audio and automation event caching.
