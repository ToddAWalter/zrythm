## Building and Installation

Prebuilt installers are available at <https://www.zrythm.org/en/download.html>.
This is the recommended way to install Zrythm.

See the following instructions if you would like to build Zrythm from source instead.

### Building From Source

> [!NOTE]
> We make heavy use of CMake's [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) module to fetch dependencies so you don't need to install any dependencies manually other than CMake and Qt.
> This guide assumes you are fine with fetching dependencies automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you distribute your builds to others, you must comply with the license terms of Zrythm and all dependencies we use, in addition to our [Trademark Policy](TRADEMARKS.md).

You can change `Release` to `Debug` below if you want to build in debug mode.

#### GNU/Linux

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) 6.9.0 or later.
2. Open a terminal and go to the root of Zrythm's source code.
3. Run `cmake -B builddir -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path to your Qt prefix>`.
4. Run `cmake --build build --config Release`.
5. Zrythm is now built at `builddir/src/gui/zrythm`.

#### macOS

1. Install Xcode, CMake and Qt 6.9.0 or later.
2. Open a terminal and go to the root of Zrythm's source code.
3. Run `cmake -B builddir -G Xcode -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path to your Qt prefix>`.
4. Open the Xcode project inside `builddir` and build it.

#### Windows

1. Install Visual Studio 2022 (CMake ships with Visual Studio) and Qt 6.9.0 or later.
2. Open Developer Powershell for Visual Studio 2022 and go to the root of Zrythm's source code.
3. Run `cmake -B builddir -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path to your Qt prefix>`.
4. Open the Visual Studio solution inside `builddir` and build it.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, you must build Qt with the same compiler and same configuration (Debug/Release) you use to build Zrythm.
