Zrythm is a digital audio workstation designed to be
featureful and easy to use. It allows limitless
automation through curves, LFOs and envelopes,
supports multiple plugin formats including LV2, VST2
and VST3, works with multiple backends including
JACK, RtAudio/RtMidi and SDL2, assists with chord
progressions via a special Chord Track and chord
pads, and can be used in multiple languages
including English, French, Portuguese, Japanese and
German.

Zrythm is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
written in C using the GTK+3 toolkit and can be
extended using [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).
