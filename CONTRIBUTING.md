Contributing to Zrythm
======================

Zrythm is a project developed mostly by volunteers from all around the world.
You are welcome to join our chatrooms and forum listed on our official website.
Tell us how would you like to help, and we will do our best to guide you.

# Project Management
We use [GitLab](https://gitlab.zrythm.org/zrythm/zrythm) as the central point
for development, maintenance and issue tracking of Zrythm.

The source files for all the components of the project, including software, web
site, documentation, and artwork, are available in our
[git repositories](https://gitlab.zrythm.org/zrythm).

# Art
We are always looking for artists to help us design and improve user
interfaces, and create multimedia material for documentation, presentations and
promotional items.

# Documentation
You can read the project documentation already available in the manual and help
us identify any errors or omissions. Creating new manuals, tutorials, and blog
entries will also help users and developers discover Zrythm.

# Programming
Source code is in the
[main Git repository](https://gitlab.zrythm.org/zrythm/zrythm/).
We use C++ as the main programming language for the various components of
Zrythm.

Make sure to read [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for more details on the development
setup, as well as the coding and cooperation conventions used in the project.

## Contributing Code
We prefer contributions in the form of [merge requests on our
GitLab instance](https://gitlab.zrythm.org/zrythm/zrythm/-/merge_requests).

The Zrythm project uses a
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) to
manage contributions. The DCO is an affirmation that you are the author of your
contribution or otherwise have the right to pass it on as a free software
patch, and that you wish to allow the Zrythm project to use your work.

Acknowledgement of this permission is done using a sign-off process in Git.
The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. You
can find a copy of the DCO at [DCO.txt](DCO.txt) in the root of this source
code distribution.

To certify your contribution, please add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` as part of your git configuration,
you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

You must use your real name (i.e., pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot
be made).
