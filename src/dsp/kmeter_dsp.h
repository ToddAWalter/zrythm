/**
 * @brief Implements a K-System meter DSP.
 *
 * The KMeterDsp class provides an implementation of a K-System meter, which is
 * a type of audio level meter designed by Bob Katz. It calculates the RMS and
 * peak values of the input audio and provides methods to read these values.
 *
 * The class is designed to be used in a real-time audio processing context,
 * with the `process()` method being called for each block of audio samples. The
 * `read()` method can then be called to retrieve the current RMS and peak
 * values.
 *
 * The class also provides methods to reset the meter and initialize it with a
 * specific sample rate.
