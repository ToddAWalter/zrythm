 * track the maximum peak and RMS values since the last read.
 *
 * The `process()` method should be called for each frame of audio
 * data, and the `read()` method can be used to retrieve the current
 * peak and RMS values.
 *
 * The `init()` method should be called to initialize the class with
 * the sample rate of the audio data.
