 * @brief Represents a node in a DSP graph.
 *
 * GraphNode is a fundamental building block of the DSP graph, responsible for
 * processing audio/MIDI data. It encapsulates the necessary functions and
 * properties to handle the processing, latency compensation, and connection
 * management within the graph.
 *
 * The class provides the following key features:
 * - Configurable processing function and name getter
 * - Playback latency management and compensation
 * - Ability to connect to other GraphNode instances
 * - Skipping of processing for muting/disabling the node
 *
 * GraphNode is designed to be used as part of the larger DSP graph system,
 * providing the necessary functionality to handle the individual nodes and
 * their interactions.
